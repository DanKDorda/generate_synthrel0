Some notebooks for generating synthrel0 style datasets from [this paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/html/SGRL/Dorda_SynthRel0_Towards_a_Diagnostic_Dataset_for_Relational_Representation_Learning_ICCVW_2019_paper.html)
* `all_angle_dood.ipynb` contains short script for generating the basic images
* `make_limiter_list.ipynb` is a script for creating permutations over the annotations in a .json file
* `synthetic_relationships_v1.ipynb` is the main script containing the class structure, generation loop, and majority of the logic

### Warning
This code has not been cleaned up since I first wrote it. As such, read at your own discretion. Very obfuscated, messy, and at times borderline insane.
